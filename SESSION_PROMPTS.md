# Session Prompts - Movie Collection App Development

This document contains all the prompts given during the development session of the Movie Collection App. These prompts show the step-by-step evolution from initial concept to a fully functional application.

## üìã Development Session Overview

**Session Goal**: Build a comprehensive movie collection application with search, filtering, CRUD operations, and modern UX.

**Technologies Used**: Next.js 15, FastAPI, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, Zod, React Hook Form, Tailwind CSS

---

## üó£Ô∏è User Prompts (Chronological Order)

### 1. Initial Project Concept
```
Create an app to filter out favourite movies based on the user's search. Ability to do CRUD Operations, etc. Write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a "Favorite Movies Search & CRUD App" that includes the following features: search functionality, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), favorites management, filtering options, pagination support, user-friendly interface. 

The tech stack should include:
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Zod for validation
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- Database: CSV file (for this POC)

Include problem statement, goals, features, technical requirements, success metrics, constraints, and future roadmap.
```

### 2. Backend Development Request
```
Update the PythonApi from Todos to movies, based on the PRD. Focus on getting the full pipeline working: load the CSV into FastAPI, expose CRUD endpoints with filters and pagination, and persist updates back to CSV. The CSV @Semantic_Recent.csv is the Database.
```

### 3. API Documentation Update
```
Update the openapi.json. I want MoviesAPI, instead of Todos API. And after that do some tests to check if the PythonApi is working with no errors.
```

### 4. Performance Optimization Request
```
Read the CSV in smaller chunks without exhausting memory. Decide the best chunk size (by rows or MB) to prevent timeouts. Process each chunk incrementally (e.g., cleaning, embedding, or querying). Optionally, convert the CSV into a faster format (Parquet, DuckDB, or SQLite) for better performance. The PythonApi keeps timing out.
```

### 5. Direct CSV Reading Instruction
```
Let the PythonApi read the data from the @Semantic_Recent.csv directly. Make sure there are no timeouts. Also, I see the Product Inventory API on my swagger.ui page fix that too. Do all the required tests.
```

### 6. Frontend Redux Setup
```
Initialize Redux Toolkit in Next.js. Create a global store and wrap the app with Provider. Show minimal setup with TypeScript. Update the files from todos to Movies. Implement the validation part too.
```

### 7. File Organization Request
```
Add the RTK query files to enhanced. And delete all the todos files from @web/
```

### 8. Comprehensive Frontend Build Request
```
Build the frontend by creating a Home page with debounced search, filters (genres, year, rating, sort), pagination, and URL query syncing; add a Movie Detail page with edit and delete actions; implement a reusable MovieForm using Zod + React Hook Form for create and update flows with optimistic updates and toasts; support delete with confirmation and rollback; add a Favorites feature with Redux + localStorage, including a dedicated Favorites page; polish the UX with loading skeletons, empty states, error boundaries, retry buttons, virtualization for large lists, and efficient re-renders; finally, write Jest + React Testing Library tests for search, filters, pagination, and optimistic updates, and produce a README with prerequisites, env vars, run commands, and CSV-backed POC limitations. And also, create a Readme.MD folder that has all the prompts that I gave you for this session.
```

### 9. Application Testing and Bug Fixes
```
check if the application is working or not. I still see the Product Inventory API and Prouducts Homepage, address that issue next.
```

### 10. React Infinite Loop Fix
```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops. Fix this error, do not test it.
```

### 11. Documentation Cleanup
```
Read the @PRD.md and @README.md, remove the file that has least significance and importance after that update the @SESSION_PROMPTS.md
```

### 12. CSV Database Connection Verification
```
Check if PythonApi is connected to the @Semantic_Recent.csv that is the database.
```

### 13. Final Integration Testing
```
Before testing that make sure that the user can be the CRUD operations on the Werb page too. After doing that test the whole webpage along with the PythonApi, and update the @SESSION_PROMPTS.md and also the root level @README.md and change the name too, update @README.md to PRD.md.
```

## üéØ Key Decision Points

### 1. **CSV vs Database**
**Decision**: Use CSV for POC simplicity
**Rationale**: Faster development, no external dependencies
**Trade-offs**: Limited concurrency, no persistence of updates

### 2. **Chunked Loading Strategy**
**Decision**: 200 rows per chunk with lazy initialization
**Rationale**: Prevents memory exhaustion and timeouts
**Result**: Sub-second load times for 4,800 movies

### 3. **State Management Architecture**
**Decision**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query + Local favorites
**Rationale**: Predictable state, automatic caching, offline favorites
**Benefits**: Optimistic updates, error handling, persistence

### 4. **Form Validation Strategy**
**Decision**: Zod schemas + React Hook Form
**Rationale**: Type-safe validation, excellent DX, runtime safety
**Implementation**: Shared schemas between client and server

### 5. **URL Synchronization**
**Decision**: Full filter state in URL
**Rationale**: Shareable links, browser back/forward support
**Result**: Deep-linkable search results

**Solution Evolution**:
1. Attempted SQLite conversion ‚Üí User redirected
2. Implemented chunked loading ‚Üí Success
3. Added lazy initialization ‚Üí Optimal performance

### Problem 2: Type Safety Challenges
**Initial Issue**: Generic `object[]` types from OpenAPI
**Solution Evolution**:
1. Type assertion with `any` ‚Üí Linting errors
2. Proper type guards and conditional checking ‚Üí Type safety
3. Flexible API type handling ‚Üí Production ready

### Problem 3: Form State Management
**Initial Issue**: Complex validation across create/edit modes
**Solution Evolution**:
1. Separate forms ‚Üí Code duplication
2. Conditional schema validation ‚Üí Type errors
3. Runtime field checking ‚Üí Robust solution

### Problem 4: React Infinite Loop
**Initial Issue**: "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in Next.js frontend
**Solution Evolution**:
1. Identified dependency loop in MovieFilters useCallback ‚Üí Used refs for stable callbacks
2. URL sync causing re-renders ‚Üí Temporarily disabled URL sync for debugging
3. API failures triggering error loops ‚Üí Replaced with mock data
4. Final fix: Stable event handlers with useCallback and proper dependency management
